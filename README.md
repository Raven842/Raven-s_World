# Raven-s_World
This is the website for a podcast/ARG (alternate reality game) and includes in person blogs from the charicters POV's, it has some un-reality elements so take caution if that is something that affects you
PLEASE DO NOT EDIT, THIS IS ONLY PUBLIC SO THAT I CAN ACCESS IT IN VS CODE AND MAY NOT REMAIN THIS WAY
most of the source code is in some way based off of templates as i am just starting out, if you like the way something looks, most of the bases are referenced at the top of the source code
