Welcome to my blog,
A  space for me to spread my wings and get weird, what will you find here 
– Poetry
– Scattered thoughts
– Reviews
– And maybe even a Diary <!-- strike-through and emphasis here -->
– An Escape?

Now for some information about me:
Bio:

"Long have I lived for an escape of these burning bones" – The person I once was, A quicksand pit I can never Escape
"I do not burn my lungs with the sweet smelling rot, for far sweeter nectar runs bitter and black through my veins" – The person I now am, pulling apart at the seems
"The flowers grow from my soul obliterating my loving decay, the mycelium holding together my bones is gone" – The person I hope to never be, Healing is Hard.

The gallery is coming soon, which is exciting, unfortunately I do not have that much artistic talent unlike <strike>Autumn</strike> so most of the things there will just be 
screen shots of cool things I want to share and that I think fits with the vibe,
